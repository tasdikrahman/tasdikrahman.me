title: About Me
---

This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, stories I've written down and software I've published.

A generalist developer, with a focus on the infrastructure side of things. I love working on building systems and software which help the developers become more efficient by abstracting out infrastructure and making it simpler for them, so that it gets out of their way. In that process, I pick up the language(s)/tool(s), which make the most sense for the task at hand, but I do have a soft spot for [python](https://python.org/), [golang](https://golang.org) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) these days.

When not working on a [side project](https://github.com/tasdikrahman), I can be found playing football (soccer if you may) or [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/38551461), watching EPL (Go Chelsea!). I do [backpack](https://tasdikrahman.me/blog/tag/travel/) whenever I get the chance to, across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while. Have picked up a very addictive habit of watching theatre companies perform. Lately been trying to improve my skills at [Argentine tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_tango) over at a milonga. You might find me with a [book/kindle](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19151223-tasdik-rahman) if we stumble upon each other.

A list of public talks given by me, can be found [here](https://tasdikrahman.me/speaking/).

I am always a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman) away if you have something interesting in mind.

If you are an `IRC` person, I will be there with the handle `tasdikrahman` hanging around OFTC as well as on freenode.

_I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never represented the opinion of any of my employers. This is a personal blog I write in my off-hours_
